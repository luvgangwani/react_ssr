 - Client Side rendering - Data from a data source (API) is sent to the client and client renders the HTML
 - Server Side rendering - HTML rendering is done on the server side and is sent to the client

 Benefits of SSR (Isomorphic / Universal)
  - Rendering large application / Applications expected to grow can use SSR as it will provide faster load times
  - The browser on which the application is rendered depends on the hardware used. Older h/w might give a lower performance as compared to newer h/w. Using SSR the performance is controlled on the server.
  - Improved SEO - Google sends its bots to index a site's page. The bots look for HTML but do not play well with JavaScript. SSR helps in this case

Next.js
